### Is The Holy Spirit Jesus’ God As Well?

**Question:**
In one of your articles you stated that the Father became Jesus’ God due to his incarnation. You argued that by becoming flesh Christ acquired a nature that was created, which therefore made him part of creation. As a result of this, Christ began submitting to the Father as his God. You further stated that the Father continues to relate to his Son as God since the Son continues to exist as a man as a result of his resurrection. With that said, does this mean that the Holy Spirit also became (and continues to be) the God of Christ? After all, if the Son submits to and honors the Father as his God by virtue of possessing a human nature that was created then why wouldn’t he also honor the Holy Spirit as God seeing that he is the other member of the Trinity who did not become flesh?

**Answer:**

The Holy Spirit did not become Christ’s God at the Incarnation. Rather, it is the Father alone who became and continues to be the God of Christ:

- Psalm 22:1, 10, 16, 18 – cf. Matthew 27:33, 35, 46; Mark 15:25, 27, 34; Luke 23:33-34; John 19:23-24
- Micah 5:2-4 – cf. Matthew 2:1-6; Luke 2:4-7
- 2 Corinthians 1:3
- Ephesians 1:17

The reason why God’s Spirit didn’t become Jesus’ God is because the Holy Bible is clear that, even though Christ operated in the power of the Holy Spirit in order to accomplish his earthly mission, it wasn’t the Spirit that sent him into the world. Nor did Christ become flesh so as to accomplish the Spirit’s will. Rather, it was the Father who sent his Son into the world:

- John 3:16-17, 34-35
- John 6:57
- John 8:42
- John 10:36
- John 11:41-42
- John 20:21
- Romans 8:3
- Galatians 4:4-5
- 1 John 4:9-10, 14

The inspired Scriptures also teach that the Lord Jesus came to perfectly accomplish the Father’s will and to speak whatever the Father commanded him to say:

- John 4:31-34
- John 5:19-20, 30, 36-38, 43
- John 6:38
- John 8:25-29, 38
- Hebrews 10:5-9

Part of the Father’s will entailed that the Spirit would be sent to aid his beloved Son to fulfill his earthly mission:

- Acts 10:36-38

Even though Jesus submitted to the Spirit’s leading, this didn’t make the Holy Spirit his God any more than Jesus submitting to and obeying his mother and adoptive father made them his God as well:

- Luke 2:41-51

That Jesus’ Incarnation didn’t necessitate his submitting to the Holy Spirit as his God can be further seen from the fact that, even though Christ continues to honor his Father as God while in heaven, he actually has the divine authority to send forth the Spirit upon believers in conjunction with the Father:

- John 1:29-34
- John 14:26
- John 15:26
- Luke 24:49
- Acts 2:31-33

The Holy Spirit is even said to be the Spirit of both the Father and the Son:

- Acts 16:6-7
- Romans 8:9-11
- Galatians 4:6-7
- Philippians 1:19
- 1 Peter 1:10-12

The reason why the Holy Spirit is also called the Spirit of Christ is because the Son has authority to send forth and command the Spirit much like the Father does:

- John 16:7, 12-15

As such, the Spirit submits to the Son in the same way that he submits to the Father.

**Summary:**
The Son does not submit to the Holy Spirit as his God despite the fact that he was dependent upon God’s Spirit to guide and empower him during his earthly ministry, since it was the Father who had decreed that such would be the case. Rather, it is the Father alone that the Son submits to and honors as his God since it was the Father who sent him and it was his will which Christ came into the world to accomplish. The Holy Spirit was sent to assist Christ to perfectly carry out the mission which the Father sent him to do.
